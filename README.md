## 🟢 **Tc Coin Blockchain**  
### 🌐 Hybrid Decentralized Blockchain App | Troanary Proof-of-Time | PWA | GitHub Pages  

The **Tc Coin Blockchain** is a **hybrid, fully decentralized blockchain app**, powered by **Troanary Proof-of-Time and Trust** principles. It starts with **zero coins** and generates **Troanary Coins (Tc)** through **human interaction, time, and trust**, rather than mining or traditional staking.

This **Progressive Web App (PWA)** runs entirely **client-side**, requires **no servers**, and is **hosted on GitHub Pages**. Members earn, send, and receive Tc Coins via **peer-to-peer sync** (Bluetooth, WebRTC, QR codes). It’s a **lightweight**, **open-source** blockchain that redefines value through **time and action**, not energy consumption.

### 🚀 **How It Works**  
1. **No Coins? No Problem!** Start with zero and **earn Tc** by spending time and building trust.  
2. **Run a Node** in your browser. Your device **stores blocks locally** and syncs P2P with others.  
3. **Send & Receive Coins** via Bluetooth, WebRTC, or QR.  
4. **Install & Share** the app as a **PWA** and earn rewards for participation.  
5. **Troanary Trust Levels** reward quality contributions and engagement.
